# Project-Pryde

`Project-Pryde` Pryde is a progressive web application designed to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections and diseases within the LGBTQ+ community. The platform offers a chatbot that answers all queries related to sexual health and hygiene, a forum for people to discuss best practices, access to medical professionals, an interactive Unity3D enabled educational section with best practices, a reading area with top blogs on sexual health and hygiene, and a self-love booth. We have conducted extensive research to obtain information for the chatbot, which is powered by NLP, AI, and Google Cloud. We have also developed an AI-based profanity filter to ensure the forum remains a safe place to discuss ideas. The platform offers a medical space for doctors to address sexual health issues, and a medical store for users to purchase prescribed medications and tools of contraception. PrydeScape, developed using Unity3D technology, offers LGBTQ+ sex education. The platform is designed to provide a safe space for individuals to discuss their sexual health and get the best possible answers tailored to their experiences. Team DANG is proud of Pryde's accomplishments, as they have created a solution that adds multidimensional value that caters to society, people, sustainability, and business. Through Pryde, the team hopes to make a genuine change in society, cater to an underrepresented section of society, and ensure individuals live happy and healthy lives.

### Inspiration:
With modern advancements, individuals have more freedom to live as they choose, and society has become more inclusive of different genders and sexual orientations. However, sexual health and hygiene practices have not kept up with these changes, and many LGBTQ+ individuals do not have access to medical professionals who specialize in their sexual health. Discussing sexual health is a sensitive topic, and individuals often avoid seeking medical advice, relying instead on generalized information from unreliable sources like Google searches. This can lead to incorrect or incomplete diagnoses. Additionally, there is a misconception that protection is unnecessary in same-gender sexual encounters, which can increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.

### What it does?
Pryde is a progressive web application built using Frontend and Backend Technologies which is aimed towards reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections and diseases within the LGBTQ+ community. It also aims towards providing a safe space for the users to openly talk about their sexual health and get the best possible answers tailor-made to their experience.

Pryde offers the following solutions:
- A chatbot which has been designed to answer all queries related to sexual health and hygiene.
- A forum for people to put forward best sexual practices they have come across.
- Interactive Unity3D enabled Educational section having best practices.
- Reading area where the top blogs related to sexual health and hygiene for LGBTQ+ on the internet are made visible.
- Self-love booth.

### Features Description:
#### THE PRYDE BOT: INTENSIVE RESEARCH AND A.I.
The questions and answers which will be available will be obtained through extensive research that shall be done from books and the web. Finally, the bot will be powered with NLP, AI and Google Cloud.

#### FORUM: A SAFE PLACE TO DISCUSS IDEAS
- Influencers post valuable information and help induce a sense of belongingness in the community.
- This information is passed through an AI based profanity filter to make sure that no cuss words are used or visible on the community platform.

#### PRYDESCAPE: SEX-ED FOR LGBTQ+
- There are limited resources on LGBTQ+.
- Knowing one’s body and proper hygiene is important for leading a healthy life, both physically and mentally.
Hence, PrydeScape is being developed using Unity3D technology to make the education interesting.

#### THE PRYDE READING AREA
- Very well-written articles are present online.
- Search filtration is essential to ensure that only the required blogs which are related to LGBTQ+ and sexual health are fetched through our custom-built API.

#### THE “YOU MATTER” SELF LOVE BOOTH
- Due to the less understanding of the community by the general public, often they have to face rude and derogatory comments.
- Having a self-love arena with handbooks on how they can explore their identity and sexuality can help in providing them access to care for their mind as well.
